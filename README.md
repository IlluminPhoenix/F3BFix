# MakeBGreatAgain
Fabric mod for fixing the `B:` in the 5th row of the F3-Debug-Screen. This should show the rendered block entities, according to findings in the code and the minecraft wiki.
However it always shows `0` instead, which this mod fixes!

This mod was created in inspiration of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHdxMqKVL-s
